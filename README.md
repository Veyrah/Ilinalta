# Ilinalta - Vanilla safe modlist

Welcome to the Ilinalta modlist, designed for those who want to enhance the game's graphics without altering the core experience. This collection features high-quality texture and mesh replacers that breathe new life into the world of Tamriel.

With no ESPs or SKSE required, your save files remain fully compatible with vanilla Skyrim. This means you can enjoy a visually upgraded experience without worrying about breaking your game or needing to start over, and always have the option to load your saves in your unmodded Skyrim or other modlists!

Explore familiar landscapes and characters with stunning detail, all enhanced by a carefully configured ENB and Reshade that improve lighting and color. Rediscover the beauty of Skyrim while keeping the gameplay intact. Dive back into your adventure with a fresh visual perspective!

Installation is done via Wabbajack and should be as simple as selecting the Ilinalta wabbajack file you download from this page and selecting the install location. If you already have Wabbajack, you can also find this modlist on there, at the browse modlists section if you check the unofficial modlist checkbox.

You can join the Ilinalta Discord if you have any questions or need help with installing the modlist.
